The cource code of the game is organized into many separate files.

I used Adobe flash builder 4 to actually turn this into a flash program.

You can import the .fxp file into Adboe flash builder. I don't know how any other flash programming things work.

You can read these files with a basic text editor like notepad.

I highly recommend using the program notepad++, but you can use whatever.

If you don't already know coding this is probably going to look very obtuse.

If you do know coding then this is going to look terribly put together.

I tried to comment most things, but probably didn't do a very good job. At some point I should release a more user friendly version, but I've procrastinated long enough already.

In any case, good luck have fun!
